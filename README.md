# DEAR FUTURE EMPLOYER

I built this tool back in school purely out of fun. Even though I was barely sick, I was on a mission to automate EVERYTHING! So this included the case for when I was actually sick. The tool would handle generating a sick note with the current date and submit a print job to my printer over Google Cloud Print (back then when it still existed).

So please don't be scared. I am taking my health really serious!!!
